\textbf{Xyce Backlog Bugs/1}: Mutual inductor jacobian error &
A jacobian term in the nonlinear mutual inductor was wrong when the bias was changing 
across the primary inductor.  This jacobian error could lead to slower nonlinear 
convergence in transient simulations.  It has been fixed. \\ \hline

\textbf{Xyce Backlog Bugs/2}: Mutual inductors have a bad device connectivity map &
>>>>>>> 38619b588 (Document fix of the CMake version reporting)
The device connectivity map is used to determine the path to ground for error checking.  
The linear and nonlinear mutual inductors were not correctly setting up 
the device connectivity map and this resulted in false warnings that some circuit 
nodes did not have a path to ground.  The warning was invalid and this issue did 
not effect Xyce's calculations.  But the warning was incorrect and could cause 
confusion.  The code has been fixed and this warning should no longer appear under
false conditions. \\ \hline

\textbf{Xyce Backlog Bugs/8}: MOSFET multiplicity not applied to noise &
None of the legacy MOSFETs (level 1,2,3, 6, 9(BSIM3) and 14 (BSIM4))
in Xyce were correctly applying the multiplicity factor (``M='') to
noise terms.  They do now. \\ \hline

\textbf{Xyce Project Backlog/260}: Fix version string in CMake development builds &
Xyce reports its version using \texttt{Xyce -v}.  With development versions of
Xyce, the reported version should include the Git SHA against which the code
was compiled along with the time of compilation. Prior to this change, CMake
would include the SHA and time at \emph{configure} time, not compilation time.
That is now fixed. \\ \hline

\textbf{Xyce Project Backlog/285}: CMake support for XyceCInterface &
The C-interface to the C++ object N\_CIR\_Xyce did not have the needed
files for building under CMake.  This issue has been resolved and the 
C-interface is now built and installed as part of Xyce. \\ \hline

\textbf{Xyce Project Backlog/302}: Xyce legacy MOSFETs do not recognize VT0 &
Xyce did not properly recognize that VT0 should be an alias for VTO in
the levels 1 through 6 legacy MOSFET devices.  These have been
recognized by every SPICE derivative since SPICE3 (though were not
recognized by SPICE2), and are now recognized by Xyce, too. \\ \hline

\textbf{Xyce Project Backlog/151}: Xyce reports error "Directory node not found" &
Xyce reports this error when non-existent solution nodes being referred to
by circuit devices and cannot be resolved.  The simulator now provides a more
informative error that indicates which solution node has not been resolved and
what device refers to this node. \\ \hline
