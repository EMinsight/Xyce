\textbf{Xyce Backlog Bugs Issue 2}: Mutual inductors have a bad device connectivity map &
The device connectivity map is used to determine the path to ground for error checking.  
The linear and nonlinear mutual inductors were not correctly setting up 
the device connectivity map and this resulted in false warnings that some circuit 
nodes did not have a path to ground.  The warning was invalid and this issue did 
not effect Xyce's calculations.  But the warning was incorrect and could cause 
confusion.  The code has been fixed and this warning should no longer appear under
false conditions. \\ \hline
