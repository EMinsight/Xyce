The following changes to the BSIMCMG 111.0.0 code were needed to make
it work with Xyce/ADMS.

1.  Modify main bsimcmg function name (in the bsimcmg.va file) to include 
    level, and add attributes.  I'm following the convention of other BSIM CMG devices
    in Xyce.  

2.  Fix the `lexp macro to remove ADMS lexical error in the bsimcmg_macros.include file.
    This macro uses a ternary operator, and it seems that in order for ADMS
    to parse it properly, it needed more parenthesis.  I've encountered
    similar problems parsing ternaries in other contexts, so this probably
    isn't surprising.
