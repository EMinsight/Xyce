The EKV model version 2.6 provided by its authors will not process
correctly in ADMS due to a number of minor problems.  As a result, the
version provided here has been modified slightly.


- The macro "NOT_GIVEN" has changed sign from -1e21 to 1e21.  That is
  because in several places where it was used it was used as
  "-`NOT_GIVEN", resulting in the preprocessor emitting "--1e-21", an
  illegal expression in ADMS.

- The white noise and flicker noise terms for the "ds" branch were
  summed together in a single contribution statement.  This usage,
  while perfectly legal Verilog-A, is incorrectly handled by the
  Xyce/ADMS system.  The two terms have been separated out into to
  separate contribution statements.
